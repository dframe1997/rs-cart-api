# Cart API

## Get started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Run `npx serverless offline`
4. Test routes, which will be available on `localhost:3000/dev`
5. Deploy to AWS using `serverless deploy`

You must run `npm run build` every time before running locally or deploying, as it is the built artifact that is used/deployed.
