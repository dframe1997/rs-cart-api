# Cart API

## Get started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Run `npx serverless offline`
   . To run this on a different port locally, use `npx serverless offline --httpPort 3003`
4. Test routes, which will be available on `localhost:3000/dev`
5. Deploy to AWS using `npx serverless deploy`

\*

You must run `npm run build` every time before running locally or deploying, as it is the built artifact that is used/deployed.
